# Abode.ly: Photos

Abode.ly is a hostel booking site where users can search through thousands of homes hosted by owners from all over the world. The photos section plays an important role in the user's decision process on which home to book. So, it's essential that the photo listings are returned to users in a timely manner.

This is the back-end system design of the photo carousel module. It was built using Express/Node.js and PostgreSQL. It was deployed on Amazon Web Services EC2 t2-micro instances. After optimization, it was able to handle traffic at over 1000 RPS, with a response speed of 20ms and error rate of 0%.
